        The GKB Ecodresser is a versatile 3-in-1 maintenance machine, purpose-built to keep natural grass sports fields and golf courses in top condition. It effectively combines soil dressing, aeration, and leveling into a single operation.

This eco-friendly approach enhances soil health, prevents weed growth, and creates a uniform surface for optimal playability. Additionally, the Ecodresser is equipped with advanced features such as adjustable working widths and stone sieves, making it suitable for various field sizes and conditions.
